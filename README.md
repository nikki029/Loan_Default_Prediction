•Banks earn a major revenue from lending loans. But it is often associated with risk. The borrower's may default on the loan. To mitigate this issue, the banks have decided to use Machine Learning to overcome this issue.

•The main objective is to develop a strong ML Model to classify if any new borrower is likely to default or not.

•ML Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XGB Classifier

•Evaluation metrics used for model performance: f1 score
